</h2>
    
 <p>While two decades ago, the internet was just a place that only tech enthusiasts participated in, nowadays, it has become the primary source for information, entertainment, and communication (Geley). Therefore, we can see how important the internet is these days and providing most accessible web pages for people has become one of the most vital requirements in web design. The attempt to give everyone access to the same information regardless of the impairments user may have is very challenging. According to Geley, fifteen percent of the world’s population which is approximately one billion people experience some form of disability with almost fifty seven million in the US alone. Thus, people with disabilities may find it is inaccessible for them to approach such online activities like shopping, sharing moments with friends, reading the news, watching TV shows, applying for jobs, booking vacations, and more as many websites do not consider their needs. In fact, providing accessible web pages has become a legal imperative. Many countries around the world have published laws which goes against web pages that discriminate against people with disabilities (Geley). For example, in the US, accessibility requirements are included in the Americans with Disabilities Act, released in 1990 (Geley).</p>
  <p> Most people may think that building an accessible website is difficult and pricey, but it does not have to. According to Stanley, color contrast can often be overlooked as web accessibility problem. It could be challenging for people who have low vision to read text from a low contrast background color (Stanley). Also, avoiding to use color as the only visual cue when you have to communicate important messages, showing an action, or prompting a response (Stanley). Usabe focus states such as focus indicators help people to be aware of which element has the keyboard focus and also help them understand where they are when navigating a site (Stanley). One of the biggest mistakes is using placeholder text as labels when designing a form (Stanley). People with low vision often use screen readers to hear the web so it is important to describe what is happening in the image by applying alternative text (Stanley). Heading mark should be used properly since screen readers use heading tag to read content (Stanley). Last, but not least, keyboard accessibility is one of the most critical aspects of web accessibility, therefore, a website should support keyboard navigation (Stanley).

    <p>Also, studies show that accessible websites are able to bring a variety of benefits like having better search results, reaching to more and bigger audience, SEO friendly, faster download times, good coding practices, and better usability (Stanley)
